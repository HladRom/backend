# Introduction :star: :star:  
The aim of this project is to develop a web application using Docker, NGINX, Node.js, and MySQL technologies. The tasks include installing and configuring the MySQL database, creating a table to store data about the technologies used in the project, configuring the backend to connect to the database, fixing the frontend to interact with the backend through an API, building the project, and deploying it using Docker containers.

## Steps Overview
- Installation and Configuration of MySQL Database: Download and install MySQL Server, configure a user and database for the project.
- Creation of Database Table: Create a table to store data about the technologies used in the project.
- Cloning and Configuration of Backend: Clone the backend from the GitHub repository and make changes to connect it to the MySQL database.
- Fixing the Frontend: Clone the frontend and make changes to interact with the backend through an API.
- Project Build: Build the backend and frontend, ensuring a successful build.
- Creation of Docker Image for NGINX: Create a Dockerfile for the frontend, configure NGINX, and build the Docker image.
- Deployment of the Application with Docker Containers: Launch the Docker container and verify that the application works correctly.

## Testing
After deploying the application, conduct testing by checking the functionality of the web application through the user interface. Ensure that data is stored and displayed correctly as expected.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the tasks were successfully completed, including setting up the MySQL database, developing the backend and frontend of the application, establishing communication between them via an API, and deploying the application using Docker containers. The project is ready for use and further development.
